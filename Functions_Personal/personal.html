    <p>Hi!</p>
        <p>For today's assignment I was supposed to create a program that relates to me personally.</p>
        <p>I decided that it would be cool to create a program that uses a function to tell what I will do in the morning depending upon the temprature.</p>
        <p>Now then lets see what I will do this morning? Will I have hot coco, coffee, or tea?</p>
    <button onclick="myFunction()">What to do?</button>
