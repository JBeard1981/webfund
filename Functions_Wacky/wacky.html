    <h1>HEY!</h1>
    <p>This week we are using Functions! So I am once again going to give you fantasy titles however this time you will have more options.</p>
    <p> Below you will find three small buttons. </p>
    <p>The first button will execute a function to generate your fantasy title based on a list of male names. </p>
    <p>The secyond button execute a function to generate a fantasy Title based upon female names.</p>
    <p>The Third and final button will tell your character's alignment. Alignment is very important in the fantasy world. Your character's alignment will tell weather they are good, evil, or chaotic and to what degree.</p>
    <p>I hope you have as much fun playing with this as I had makeing it!</p>
